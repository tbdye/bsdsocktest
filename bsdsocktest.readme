Short:    Amiga bsdsocket.library conformance test suite
Uploader: thomas@tfenet.com (Thomas Dye)
Author:   thomas@tfenet.com (Thomas Dye)
Type:     comm/tcp
Version:  0.2.0
Requires: AmigaOS 2.0+, 68020+, bsdsocket.library compatible TCP/IP stack
Architecture: m68k-amigaos

bsdsocktest is an open-source conformance test suite for the Amiga
bsdsocket.library API.  It exercises the BSD socket interface as
implemented by Amiga TCP/IP stacks (Roadshow, AmiTCP, Miami, Genesis)
and by emulators (Amiberry, WinUAE).  The suite contains 142 tests
across 12 categories, covering socket lifecycle, data transfer, async
I/O, name resolution, descriptor transfer, and throughput benchmarks.

Features:

  - 142 tests in 12 categories (socket, sendrecv, sockopt, waitselect,
    signals, dns, utility, transfer, errno, misc, icmp, throughput)
  - Self-contained loopback tests run without any network
  - Network tests use a Python host helper (included)
  - Compact dashboard output on screen with optional verbose mode
  - Full TAP v12 machine-readable log file
  - Data-driven known-failures system per TCP/IP stack
  - Supports both CLI and Workbench launch (with Tool Types)
  - Pagination with automatic screen size detection
  - Ctrl-C handling for clean interruption

Usage:

  From the CLI, copy bsdsocktest to your Amiga and run:

    bsdsocktest

  This runs all loopback tests.  For network tests, start the host
  helper on a reachable machine:

    python3 bsdsocktest_helper.py

  Then on the Amiga:

    bsdsocktest HOST <host-ip>

  Use LIST to see available categories, VERBOSE for per-test detail,
  or CATEGORY <name> to run a single category.  Results are written
  to bsdsocktest.log (TAP v12 format) in the current directory.

Compatibility:

  Tested against Roadshow 4.364: 138 passed, 4 known stack deviations,
  0 unexpected failures.  The known deviations are documented behavioral
  differences (MSG_OOB not supported, loopback RST generation, SET-only
  errno pointer tags with no GET support) and do not indicate bugs in
  the test suite.
